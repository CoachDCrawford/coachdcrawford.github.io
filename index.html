    <h1>Dale Crawford</h1>
    <h2>Builder. Leader. Culture Driver.</h2>
    <p>I don’t wait to be asked. I step up when something needs to be built, fixed, or led.</p>

    <p>That’s what happened with the Humboldt Park Patriots — a youth football program with potential, but no real infrastructure. No systems. No vision. So I stepped in and took the reins. Not because I needed the title, but because I saw what it could be. Now, it’s becoming a destination program on Chicago’s West Side — mission-first, mentorship-driven, and built for scale.</p>

    <p>Before that, I spent years in hospitality management, leading under fire. I managed teams of over 100, balancing personalities from teenagers to 60-year-old line cooks. I learned Spanish because if I was going to lead people, I needed to meet them where they were.</p>

    <p>That’s where I learned urgency, adaptability, and how to lead without needing a podium. Just presence, command, and the standard.</p>

    <p>But I wanted more. I studied for the GMAT at 2 a.m. after closing the restaurant. Earned a scholarship to DePaul. Took a $13/hour internship and climbed my way to supporting a $15B business line in corporate America. I didn’t network my way in. I performed my way up.</p>

    <p>Now I’m building Rankd, growing the Patriots, and leading my family—all while knowing that if freedom is the goal, I have to create the path myself.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “It’s not about what you’re capable of — it’s about what you’re willing to do.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>I coach. I build. I lead. And when I see potential—in a team, a program, or a person—I chase it hard and bring others with me. Let the others play small. I’m already on the field.</p>
